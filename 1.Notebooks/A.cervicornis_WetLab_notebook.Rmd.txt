## Tried IPAM with Danielle’s computer


* Camera driver issues


## Things we need to check:


* IPAM issues
* Volume of tanks + reserve water below (semi-closed system) (Was ok)
* Where can we set up IPAM and BW stations in the lab? (limited counter space)
* Ask Ian if outlet in back right side of lab (that feeders are plugged into) is on a timer (It is not) 
* Need bubble wrap or newspaper for transporting corals (got it, AP)

### Blasting protocole trial (AP, SP)
1. Got 5 healthy FM19 fragments 
2. Blasted them in fume hood (works pretty well)
3. Result: 80mL of not so thick blastate 
4. Note: Adjust airgun liquid flow 


5. Got 4 frozen diseased fragments 
6. Blasted them in fume hood 
7. Result was 45mL of blastate, thicker and darker 
8. Added filtered seawater up to 80mL to make healthy and diseased volumes comparable 
9. Split them into 2 falcon tubes, one with 20 beads and one without. 
10. Vortexed them for 10 minutes to homogenize tissue
11. There was no noticeable difference between tubes with and without beads


### Test homogenates
1. Got 10 fragments from Kelsey genotype in the TT (extras)
2. Glued them to tags
3. Took pictures in 4 angles

* Moved the corals to their assigned diseased tanks 


* Made a bleach bucket


# October 15, 2020


## Feeding (AP, DK)


* Corals fed for 1h in separated glass aquaria 
* 1g of reef roids per tank
* Unfortunately things went slow and corals were in the dark for a while


## IPAM (AP)


* All good


## BW (DK)


* Replaced battery in YSI
* Values look low. 
* Salinity is considerably higher today


## homogenate trial round 2 (SR)
* One sample showed a small amount of tissue loss after the trial experiment.
* To increase the infection to other fragments the non-infected fragments were injured with the same razor blade. In addition more fragments were collected from the extra healthy tank and also injured. Both sets of fragments were photographed. 
* About three fragments were zip tied to the disease fragment and others were placed near it.
* In addition the leftover refrigerated homogenate made on Oct 13 was also added to the tank.
* The tank was 5.5 (~2L) and had a pump running inside but had no new incoming water.

## Coral injury (SR, AP)


* All fragments were injured with a razor blade. The injury was about 1 cm from the base (~3 polyps from the base). The injury was made in a circular manner around the base. One razor blade was used per tank and the razor blade was bleached prior to injuring each fragment. 
* After the injury each fragment was photographed. 
* This process took ~1.5 minutes per fragment and took about 6 hours to complete.


Injury of large fragment (AP)
* A large kelsey fragment was injured and placed in the disease trail 5L tank to propagate disease. This was done because the other small fragments died and we needed more tissue to make a disease slurry.






# October 17, 2020


## Disease dosing  (AP, SR)


* Photos for this day are found here


### Placebo homogenate


* Selected 16 health fragments (5 genotypes[Kelsey, FM14, FM9,FM19,U44]) and photographed them together.
* After selection fragments were photographed and cleaned in 0.22um FSW and placed in autoclaved beakers with 0.22um FSW.
 *Blasted them in fume hood (detailed protocol on protocols.io)
* Started at 13, finished 13:46
*Total volume obtained ~112mL and photographed post blast.


### Disease homogenate


* Selected 7 diseased fragments (tag# 456 had only a small amount of tissue on the tip) and photographed them together.
* After selection fragments were photographed and cleaned in 0.22um FSW and placed in autoclaved beakers with 0.22um FSW.
*Blasted them in fume hood (detailed protocol on protocols.io)
* Total volume obtained ~62mL[i]
*Tags used (A147, CR054, 456, 411, a kelsey fragment, CR055, and one unknown tag and genotype)


### Homogenates


* Placed all five 50mL falcon tubes on a vortexer for ~10 min with steel beads inside to break up mucus and tissue.
* To normalize the amount of homogenate to use per treatment, fragments were paired by healthy and diseased based on tissue area as photographed.
* Mixed all falcon tubes with placebo homogenate in a ziplock bag
* Took 62mL and brought up to 80mL with 0.22um FSW (This was to dose two tanks with one tube and to keep half the homogenate in the refrigerator)
* Mixed in a ziplock bag
* Split into 2 falcon tubes (Tube labels: Healthy 2 and Healthy 3)
* Leftover placebo homogenate (112-62)mL was kept in fridge


* Brought disease up to 80mL with FSW
* Mixed in a ziplock bag
* Splitted into 2 falcon tubes (Disease 1 and Disease 2)


* Placed all homogenates into fridge


### Dosing 


*Corals were removed from aquaria. 500 ul of homogenate was pipetted directly on the scared area of each fragment.  ~3min out of water.
*Coral were placed in 5L aquaria and these aquaria were placed in larger aquaria for temperature control. 
* 20*20*40cm = 16L of water were added to the aquaria to completely cover the fragments


* Corals dosed in closed system for ~3 hours

## Disease (AP)


* Took pictures of diseased and placebo trial frags in TT
* Monitored experimental corals, no one is sick yet
 
### FACTS (AP, SR, GS)


* Got one healthy, healthy in disease, and disease in disease fragment from Kelsey-1 and delivered it to Grace to run FACS
* Grace  gave us four aliquots totalling 160,000 cells, it's normal to expect 30% loss. These cells were from diseased fragments and were cell populations not found in healthy samples.
*Sample #5 for DNA/RNA extractions was collected by pulling three of the cell sorted aliquots (150,000 cells). The remainder 10,000 cells will be used for gram-staining  
* Grace also conducted a phagocytosis assay and found 6x higher phagocytosis than the healthy fragment.

# October 30, 2020


## Feeding (DK)


* Pumps off, fed for 1 h in glass tanks at 8:50
* Corals darkadapted as they were feeding


## IPAMing (AP, DK, SR) 


* Nikkis computer was super slow, had to use Baker’s.




## Disease (DK, SR, AP)


### Coral injury and DNA/RNA samples for nutrient effects


*  All fragments were injured with a razor blade. The injury was made in a circular manner, above the first injury made on Oct 26. One razor blade was used per tank (SR). Bleached tank 2 was skipped.


* This injuring process was used to collect samples from a subset of corals in ambient and nutrient treatments. One fragment per genotype in tanks 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 were sampled (n=60). Tank 2 (ambient) was not sampled because of heat stress. Tank 3 (NH4) was not sampled to balance sample numbers from echa treatment, and chose because it has not had any mortality yet. (AP). 
* Samples collected with a new-corner of a razor blade and placed on DNA/RNA shield.
* Sample numbers 18-77. Moved to -80 in Box #2.
* Fragment A035 was not sampled (Too small). Instead sampled A020 from the same tank genotype.


### Tissue loss
* After IPAMing and while injuring we saw that A009 had TL. Sample # 78 was collected from the middle.   


### New diseased corals (AP, DK, SR)


* Suspected to be fireworm predation. Tissue missing in tips, not bottom. Some tips with all dead skeletons suggest that lesions did not progress after predation stopped. 


* Corals were ordered and pictures taken to evaluate lesion progression tomorrow. 


## Nutrients (DK)


* NH4 samples (#74) collected at 8:45 AM-> Frozen 


* Water flow (mL/min) (DK)
* T1: 208
* T2: 216
* T5: 200
* T6: 204


T2 had dead corals from bleaching. We increased water flow during the day and calibrated again to ~200 in the afternoon.

## Bleached corals (AP)


In addition to 23, 25, 32, 82, and 469 (first to die), corals 3, 98, 44, 59, 80, and 93 were moved from tank 2 to tank 10 since they have a lot of tissue loss.


## TL (AP)


* Corals A097 (sample79) and A022 (sample 80) in elevated nutrients that had TL
* Samples preserved in DNA/RNA shield


## Disease (AP, SR)


### Frozen blastate


* 3 fragments from Kelsey-1 with TL progression were blasted
* Volume?[j]
* After blasting pictures


### New corals blastate 


Diseased blastate 


* We started with diseased homogenate since we already did the frozen diseased one 
* Selected 7 fragments showing TL (bubbling) (AP, SR)
* Took pictures in 2 sides (AP)
* Rinse them with 0.22 um FSW and placed them in autoclaved beaker with FSW (AP, SR)
* Cut fragments to remove dead skeletons (AP, SR)
* Blasted with 0.22 um FSW, one fragment was discarded (not blasted very well) (AP, SR)
* Obtained 135 mL of blastate
* Skeletons weighted 52.6g
* The homogenate from each 50mL tube (3 tubes total) were mixed in ziplock bags where the homogenate was collected. 
*Steel beads (~6) were placed into each tube and were vortexed for 10min


Healthy blastate 
* tweezers and airbrush gun were cleaned with soap, ethanol, and bleach. 
* Selected 6 fragments ~ 5cm long (AP)
* Took pictures in 2 sides (AP)
* Rinse them with FSW and placed them in autoclaved beaker with FSW
* Obtained 75 mL of blastate
* Skeletons weighted  ~49g
* Brought the homogenate to same volume as diseases by adding 60mL of FSW
* The homogenate from each 50mL tube (3 tubes total) were mixed in ziplock bags where the homogenate was collected. 
*Steel beads (~6) were placed into each tube and were vortexed for 10min


### Tank setup (DK)
* 5.5 G tanks were cleaned with 10% bleach and 70% ethanol. They were then cleaned with freshwater.
*  They were then filled to ~15cm  
* These tanks were placed inside the larger tanks to buffer temperature
* Coral fragments were then placed in the 5.5 G tanks


### Coral infection


* To balance treatments due to the loss of an entire tank due to bleaching (see October 29, 2020) fragments were moved as follows:


* Corals in tank 2 (Ambient-Pathogen were discarded because of bleaching). Moved to tank 10.
* Corals in tank 6 (Originally Ambient-Placebo) were reallocated to Ambient-Pathogen and moved to tank 2
* Corals in tank 5 (Ambient-Placebo) were splitted between tanks 5 and 6 to allow for replication in the Ambient-Placebo treatment. 


* Dosed all tanks with a 25mL serological pipette:


* Tanks 5-6 with 25 mL of tube # 1 healthy homogenate @ 9:00 PM (Tank 6 still had original tank 6 corals)
* Tanks 7-8 with 25 mL of tube # 2 healthy homogenate @ 9:05 PM
* Tanks 5-8 with additional 6 mL of tube # 3 healthy homogenate @ 9:10 PM


* Tank1 with 25 mL of tube # 1 diseased homogenate @ 9:14 PM 
* Tanks 3-4 with 25 mL of tube # 2 diseased homogenate @ 9:18 PM


* Stopped and moved corals from tank 6 to tank 2


*  Tank 2 with 25 mL of tube # 3 diseased homogenate @ 10:26 PM 
*  Tanks 1-4 with additional 6 mL of tube # 3 diseased homogenate @ 10:28 PM


* DNA samples from blastate were collected after dosing the tanks (SR)
* Sample 87: 200uL of healthy homogenate 
* Sample 88: 200uL of diseased homogenate [k]

## TL 


* 3 corals with TL: 


* A056 was not sampled. TL on base close to scratching ring 
* A021 was sampled (sample 81). TL on base close to scratching ring 
* A034 was not sampled. All tissue was gone


## Tanks (Aquaria)


* Added more water to aquaria to bring them to 22cm depth.
* Levels did not look the same across them before.


### New diseased corals


* More corals showed disease progression with gross bubbling tissue 
* One sample collected for histology 


## Sample collections


### Histology (SR)
* One sample was collected showing bubbling for histology labeled #1
* One samples was taken from healthy samples used for the healthy homogenates


### DNA/RNA (AP)
* A021 was sampled (sample 81)


### Frozen fragments (SR)
* Three fragments from the healthy colonies were collected and frozen at -80C to potentially be used as a healthy homogenate. 


## Nutrients (AP)


* NH4 samples (#76) collected at 3:00 from 5.5 G aquaria  
* NH4 samples (#77) collected at 3:45 from 5.5 G tanks after water was added to 22cm depth.

* NH4 samples (#83) collected at 3:55 PM-> Frozen 
* Added 1L of glass tank water to each aquaria


## TL (AP)


### AM samples (10:30-11:30): 


*A018, A007 (sample 92), A121 (sample 93) have TL. A018 was completely gone. 
* A091 (sample 94) paired A121. 
* Placebo NH4 are not going to be paired. 


### Observed blisters in T1


* FM6: 243, 256
* FM9: 228 
* FM14: 264, 283


Blisters mainly in branches tips


### PM samples (6:05-6:34PM): 


* 205 (sample 97), 253 (sample 98), A027 (sample 100) and A118 (sample 101) have TL.
* 215 (sample 95), 231 (sample 96) and A036 (sample 99) were sampled as pairs. 
* A118 (U41) does not have a coral to pair. 


All PM samples except A118 (U41) were sampled for FACs 


* Always sample pairs before the actual corals with TL. 
* Pairs moved back to the tanks, A036 might be too small to make it. 


*A163 started a little of TL. Took pictures but not samples. 


* T1 blisters are gone.

# November 5, 2020


## Diseased corals source (AP)


* Lesion progress is slower in the only diseased fragment left. Other fragments in the tank look healthy




## Nutrients (DK, AP)


* NH4 samples (#84) collected at 9:45 AM-> Frozen 
* NH4 samples (#85) collected at 3:30 PM-> Frozen 
* Added 10L of new water to all tanks and 1mL of NH4 stock 1 to NH4 tanks


## Fed (DK)


* Fed at 11 AM outside of aquaria
* All pumps turned off, fed 1g of Reefroids in 100 mL per tank 


### AM samples (10:30-11:30): 


* T8 (nutrient placebo): A101 (Thin tissue, sample 109), A045 (TL base, sample 110), A010 (Thin tissue sample 111) were sampled. Samples not paired. Not FACs samples.


*T1 (ambient disease): A005 (TL base, sample 112), A016 (thin tissue, sample 113), and 281 (TL base, sample 114) were sampled. Pairs sampled: A012 (sample 102), A028 (sample 103), and 276 (sample 104). Sampled for FACs.


*T3 (nutrients disease): 247 (TL base, 115), A058 (TL base, sample, 116), were sampled. A001 was gone and not sampled. Pairs sampled: 258 (sample 105), A051 (sample 106). Sampled for FACs.[l][m]


*T4 (nutrients disease): A163 (TL base), A107 (TL base + thin, sample, not pair available), A176 (TL base) and 183 (thin tissue) were sampled. Paired samples A162 (sample 107), A188 (sample 108). Sampled for FACs.  


### PM samples (2:40 PM): 
*T1 (ambient disease): A170 (TL base, sample 122). Paired with A160 (sample 121). Sampled for FACs.


At ~ 7:00 pm A061 showed about 20% TL as of 8:30 pm A161 showed potential TL (samples for A161 and A061 will be collected in the AM).
